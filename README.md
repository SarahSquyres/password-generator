# Password Generator Challenge 3

## Challenge Goals

The purpose of this challenge is to create an interactive application that generates a random password for the user.

In this challenge, an employee needs to generate a random password in order to protect sensitive information.


## Tools Used

* VSS
* Git
* Git Hub
* Dev Tools


## Repairs and Modifications

* Defined arrays
* Randomized arrays
* Grab random characters using "for loops"
* Created prompts for user preferences
* Display password for user


## Application Function

When the user opens the app, they are presented with a button that says "Generate Password."  When the user clicks the button, they are prompted to enter the number of characters they would like in their password (password must be between 8 and 128).  They are also asked if they would like uppercase, lowercase, numbers and/or symbols in their password (at least one character type must be selected).

Once prompts are completed, user will be provided with a password.


## What I Learned

I learned about JavaScript functionality and syntax.  JavaScript is a powerful tool that allows users to interact with applications.
